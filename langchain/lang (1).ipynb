      "The sky is blue primarily due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Sunlight is White Light:** Sunlight, which appears white to us, is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow (the visible spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). Each color has a different wavelength, with violet and blue having the shortest wavelengths and red having the longest.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Earth's Atmosphere:** Earth's atmosphere is composed of tiny gas molecules, primarily nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Rayleigh Scattering:** When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, these tiny gas molecules scatter the light. Rayleigh scattering specifically describes what happens when light interacts with particles much smaller than its wavelength.\n",
      "    *   **Key Principle:** Rayleigh scattering is much more effective for **shorter wavelengths** of light than for longer ones. In fact, the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (1/λ⁴).\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Blue Light Scatters More:** Because blue and violet light have the shortest wavelengths, they are scattered much more strongly and in all directions by the tiny nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere than the longer-wavelength colors like red, yellow, and green.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **What We See:** When you look up at the sky, you are seeing this scattered blue light coming from every direction. This makes the sky appear blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Why Not Violet?** While violet light has an even shorter wavelength and scatters even more, our eyes are slightly less sensitive to violet light, and there's also less violet light in the sun's spectrum to begin with. The combination makes blue the dominant perceived color.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:** The tiny molecules in Earth's atmosphere act like tiny prisms, preferentially scattering the shorter-wavelength blue light across the sky, making it appear blue to our eyes. The longer-wavelength colors (red, yellow, green) are not scattered as much and tend to travel more directly from the sun to our eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is also why:\n",
      "*   The sun appears yellowish during the day (some blue light has been scattered away).\n",
      "*   The sun appears red or orange at sunrise and sunset (when the sun is low on the horizon, its light has to travel through a much greater thickness of atmosphere, scattering away even more blue and green light, leaving primarily the reds and yellows).\n",
      "*   Space appears black (there's no atmosphere to scatter light).\n"

      "The sky is blue because of a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**, which describes how light interacts with particles much smaller than its wavelength. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Sunlight is White Light:** What we perceive as white sunlight is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow (the visible spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). Each color has a different wavelength. Red light has the longest wavelength, and violet light has the shortest.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Earth's Atmosphere:** Before sunlight reaches our eyes, it has to travel through Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is composed of tiny gas molecules (like nitrogen and oxygen) and small particles.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Scattering of Light:** When sunlight hits these tiny molecules and particles in the atmosphere, it gets scattered in all directions. However, this scattering isn't uniform for all colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Rayleigh Scattering and Wavelengths:**\n",
      "    *   **Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet light)** are scattered much more efficiently and intensely than longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow light). Blue light is scattered about 10 times more than red light.\n",
      "    *   This is because the tiny atmospheric particles are roughly the same size as the wavelengths of blue and violet light, making them very effective at scattering these shorter waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Why We See Blue:**\n",
      "    *   As sunlight enters the atmosphere, a lot of the blue and violet light is scattered across the entire sky, coming at us from all directions.\n",
      "    *   This scattered blue light is what we see, making the sky appear blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Why Not Violet?**\n",
      "    *   You might wonder why the sky isn't violet, since violet light has an even shorter wavelength than blue and is scattered even more. There are two main reasons:\n",
      "        *   The sun emits slightly less violet light than blue light.\n",
      "        *   Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than to violet light.\n",
      "    *   So, while some violet light is scattered, the combination of less violet light from the sun and our eyes' sensitivity makes us perceive the sky as blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **What About Other Colors (Sunrise/Sunset)?**\n",
      "    *   The longer wavelength colors (yellow, orange, red) are scattered much less. They tend to travel in a straighter line through the atmosphere.\n",
      "    *   At sunrise or sunset, the sun's light has to travel through *much more* atmosphere to reach our eyes. By the time it gets to us, almost all the blue light has been scattered away. What's left are the longer wavelengths – the reds, oranges, and yellows – creating those beautiful sunset colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, the sky is blue because the tiny particles in our atmosphere are just the right size to preferentially scatter the shorter, bluer wavelengths of sunlight in all directions."

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "3.  **Scattering:** When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it collides with these gas molecules and particles. This causes the light to be scattered in all directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Wavelength Matters:**\n",
      "    *   **Blue and violet light** have shorter wavelengths.\n",
      "    *   **Red and orange light** have longer wavelengths.\n",

      "7.  **Why Not Violet?** While violet light is scattered even more than blue light, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light. Also, some of the violet light is absorbed higher in the atmosphere, and the sun emits slightly less violet light than blue light.\n",
      "\n",

      "Lily loved her room. It had a window seat piled with fluffy cushions, a rainbow rug, and a shelf full of her favorite stuffed animals. But when the sun went down, and the shadows stretched long and twisty, her room felt… different.\n",
      "\n",
      "It started with the whispers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not loud whispers, just soft, like dry leaves rustling right outside her ear, even when her window was closed tight. Lily, who was seven, would pull her blanket up to her chin and squeeze her eyes shut. \"It's just the wind,\" she'd tell herself, but the wind didn't usually sound like it was trying to spell out her name.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night, the whispers were clearer. \"L-i-l-y…\" they seemed to sigh, right from the corner of her room where her big, wooden toy chest sat. Lily held her breath, her heart thumping like a trapped bird. She peeked over her blanket. The toy chest lid was slightly ajar. She was sure she'd closed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next night, it wasn't just whispers. There was a soft, rhythmic *tap-tap-tap*. It came from inside her closet. Lily knew her closet. It was full of clothes and shoes and a few forgotten board games. Nothing that should be tapping.\n",
      "\n",
      "She tried to be brave. \"Hello?\" she whispered, her voice a tiny squeak in the dark. The tapping stopped. Lily waited, her eyes wide. Then, a faint giggle, like tiny bells tinkling, drifted from behind the closet door. It wasn't a happy giggle. It sounded… cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily screamed. Her mom rushed in, flipping on the light. \"Lily-bug, what's wrong?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily pointed a trembling finger at the closet. \"There's something in there! It's tapping and giggling!\"\n",

      "Lily knew it wasn't a dream. She could still feel the cold shiver the giggle had left behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a few nights, nothing happened. Lily started to relax, thinking maybe the \"thing\" had gone away. But then, one evening, as she was getting ready for bed, she saw it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her favorite doll, Rosie, sat on her dresser. Rosie had big blue eyes and a sweet smile. But tonight, Rosie's head was tilted at a strange angle, and her blue eyes seemed to be staring, not at Lily, but at the closet door. And then, very slowly, Rosie's painted smile seemed to stretch, just a tiny bit wider, almost like a smirk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily froze. She didn't touch Rosie. She just backed away slowly, got into bed, and pulled her blanket over her head, leaving only a tiny space to breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "She lay there, listening. The whispers were back, closer this time, right outside her blanket. \"L-i-l-y… come play…\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, a soft, scraping sound. It sounded like something was being dragged across her rainbow rug. Slowly, carefully, Lily pulled her blanket down just enough to peek out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The toy chest lid was wide open. And Rosie, her favorite doll, was no longer on the dresser.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was sitting on the edge of the open toy chest, her head still tilted, her smile impossibly wide. And from inside the chest, Lily heard the soft, cold giggle again, followed by a tiny, muffled *tap-tap-tap*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily didn't scream this time. She just closed her eyes, pulled the blanket tight, and wished for the sun to come up, knowing that even in the daylight, Rosie's smile might still be a little too wide, and the toy chest might still hold a secret that only came out in the dark.\n"

His father\\'s brother Josif was a lecturer at a military academy who wrote several textbooks on mathematics.\\nTesla\\'s mother, Georgina \"Đuka\" Mandić (1822–1892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother\\'s genetics and influence.\\nTesla was the fourth of five children. In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby town of Gospić, where Tesla\\'s father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. Later in his patent applications, before he obtained American citizenship, Tesla would identify himself as \"of Smiljan, Lika, border country of Austria-Hungary\".\\n\\n\\n=== Education ===\\n\\nIn 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to ')]\n"
