      "content=\"The sky appears blue to our eyes because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by small particles or molecules in the atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\\n\\n1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of a broad spectrum of colors, including all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).\\n2. **Light encounters tiny molecules**: The sunlight encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) in the atmosphere. These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\\n3. **Scattering occurs**: When light hits these tiny molecules, it is scattered in all directions. The amount of scattering that occurs depends on the wavelength of the light. Shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange).\\n4. **Blue light is scattered the most**: Because blue light has a shorter wavelength (around 450-495 nanometers), it is scattered more than any other color by the tiny molecules in the atmosphere. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\\n5. **Our eyes see the scattered blue light**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all directions. This is why the sky appears blue to us, especially during the daytime when the sun is overhead.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the sky can appear different colors under various conditions, such as:\\n\\n* During sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the scattering of light by atmospheric particles and the angle of the sun.\\n* On a cloudy day, the sky can appear gray or white due to the scattering of light by cloud droplets.\\n* At high altitudes or in areas with low atmospheric pressure, the sky can appear more intense blue due to the reduced scattering of light.\\n\\nIn summary, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the atmosphere, which scatters shorter wavelengths (like blue light) more than longer wavelengths.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 457, 'prompt_tokens': 42, 'total_tokens': 499, 'completion_time': 0.904628534, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.001438657, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.318677522, 'total_time': 0.906067191}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_f8b414701e', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'} id='lc_run--019b87f1-b0af-7901-a05f-31c06a8ec819-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 42, 'output_tokens': 457, 'total_tokens': 499}\n"

Emily loved to explore the town and play with her friends, but she had one major fear: the abandoned house on the hill.\\n\\nThe house was said to be haunted by the ghost of a mean old lady who used to live there. The townspeople would whisper to each other about the strange noises and movements they would see coming from the house at night.\\n\\nOne dark and stormy evening, Emily\\'s friends dared her to go into the abandoned house and prove that she wasn\\'t afraid. Emily was hesitant at first, but she didn\\'t want to seem scared in front of her friends. So, she took a deep breath and stepped inside the creepy old house.\\n\\nAs she walked through the creaky hallways, the wind howled outside, making the trees creak and the windows rattle. Emily\\'s heart was racing, and she could feel her fear growing with every step. Suddenly, she heard a strange noise coming from upstairs.\\n\\nIt sounded like someone was walking around, but Emily knew she was alone in the house. She tried to be brave and started to climb the stairs, but her legs felt like jelly. As she reached the top, she saw a door at the end of the hall that was slightly ajar.\\n\\nEmily slowly pushed the door open and found herself in a room filled with old toys and clothes. But what caught her attention was a music box in the center of the room, playing a haunting melody. Suddenly, the music stopped, and Emily heard a faint whisper in her ear: \"Get out while you still can.\"\\n\\nEmily didn\\'t wait to hear anything else. She turned around and ran down the stairs as fast as she could, not stopping until she was back outside in the stormy night. From that day on, Emily never went near the abandoned house again, and she never told anyone what she heard that night.\\n\\nBut some say that on stormy nights, you can still hear the sound of a little girl running down the hill, trying to escape the ghost of the mean old lady who haunts the abandoned house.

His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879), was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church. His father\\'s brother Josif was a lecturer at a military academy who wrote several textbooks on mathematics.\\nTesla\\'s mother, Georgina \"Đuka\" Mandić (1822–1892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother\\'s genetics and influence.\\nTesla was the fourth of five children. In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby town of Gospić, where Tesla\\'s father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. Later in his patent applications, before he obtained American citizenship, Tesla would identify himself as \"of Smiljan, Lika, border country of Austria-Hungary\".\\n\\n\\n=== Education ===\\n\\nIn 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to ')]\n"
